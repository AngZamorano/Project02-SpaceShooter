Project 2 2/16/2025
Create a spaceshooter sytle 2D game that follows the citeria given and add some extra stuff to it
## Implementation
Added 2 levels and change the first one
First level has an extra enemy that moves to the right, the second level has 4 enemies and 4 asteriods, and level 3 has a huge boss that shoots two bigger bullets instead of the one
Also added a screen that shows when you beat the boss that says congratulations and show how long you took and your score
Add 3 different weapon types that change based on score, the first starting one has less range and takes longer to fire and is green, the second tier fires a bit faster
and also fires two additional bullets to the left and right, the 3rd tier changes the color to red, and makes the bullets bigger, and ups damage, and did I also mentioned it fires faster
the last tier just has no cooldown to the firing, so you can just spam the boss with it.
I did have a problem though, for some reason in the boss level the player couldn't lose lived because of an indexOutOfRangeError, and I had no clue to fix it in the block code
